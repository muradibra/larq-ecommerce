# E-Commerce web application with React.js

This is an e-commerce web application that i have created using React.js. For state management, I have used Redux Toolkit.
And for API, I have used json-server. 

To view this project on your machine, clone this repository, open it in VS Code and write the following commands in the terminal:

- npm i
- npm i -g json-server
- json-server --watch db.json

Open another terminal and write this command: 

- npm run dev

Open the browser and go to "localhost:5173" to view the application.
